# React Native Course Notes - Academind by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy

* React is platform agnostic!
  * react-dom attaches it to the browser
  * react-native attaches it to the iOS and Android
* React native exposes some special components which will be compiled to native components and also some special APIs such as the camera
* Remember that these special components such as ```<View></View>``` are compiled to the native ones depending on iOS or Android (RN does this mapping on its own) and not the JS, React Native runs a JS process to execute your logic!
  * So your JS runs as JS and is not compiled!

* Expo CLI vs React Native CLI
  * Expo makes life a little easier, more than RN CLI
* ```npm i -g expo-cli```
* ```Expo init {course name}```
* Install the Expo Go app and scan barcode after running ```npm start```
* Install emulators
  * XCODE - iOS
  * Android Studio
* Remember that HTML elements will not work on RN cause native apps are not browsers and they do not have a DOM
