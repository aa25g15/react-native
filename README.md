# React Native Course Notes - Academind by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy

* React is platform agnostic!
  * react-dom attaches it to the browser
  * react-native attaches it to the iOS and Android
* React native exposes some special components which will be compiled to native components and also some special APIs such as the camera
* Remember that these special components such as ```<View></View>``` are compiled and not the JS, React Native runs a JS process to execute your logic!
  * So your JS runs as JS and is not compiled!
